            <h3>Beginning</h3>
            <p>Our garden started with a simple idea: to bring people together and grow fresh produce for the local community. It was a small project, but the idea of cultivating relationships through gardening quickly took root.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Growing Together</h3>
            <p>As more people joined, the garden grew, and so did the sense of community. With each plant that sprouted, new friendships bloomed, and the bond among neighbors strengthened. The garden became a symbol of collective effort and shared values.</p>
